Data Types
----------

Data types are the types of data that a variable can hold.

There are two types of data types:


Points on Data Types
--------------------

Data memebrs declared within a class.

Local variables declared within a method.


Example: 

class sample{
    int m// data memebers

    void method(){
        int n;// local variables
    }

    main(){
        sample s = new sample();

        sop(s.m);// default value is 0

        s.method();// it will give u the error as local variables should be initialized.
    }
}

 The default value is applicable for data memebers only.

Memeory allocation for refernence data type is done during runtime using new operator.



Type Casting
------------

Converting one data type to another.
 

Types of  Casting 
-----------------
 
1. Implicit Casting
2. Explicit Casting


Implicit Casting
----------------

Implicit casting is done by the compiler. it converts from lower data type to higher data type.

Example: 
int a = 10;
float b = a;


Explicit Casting
----------------
Explicit casting is done by the programmer. it converts from lower data type to higher data type.

Example: 

long a = 10;
int b=x;//error as x is of type long
int b = (int)a;



jshell is tool to execute the java statements.

jshell> int a = 10;
10

write jshell in cmd 

and for exit jshell type exit
