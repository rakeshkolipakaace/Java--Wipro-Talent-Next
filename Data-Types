Data Types
----------

Data types are the types of data that a variable can hold.

There are two types of data types:


Points on Data Types
--------------------

Data memebrs declared within a class.

Local variables declared within a method.


Example: 

class sample{
    int m// data memebers

    void method(){
        int n;// local variables
    }

    main(){
        sample s = new sample();

        sop(s.m);// default value is 0

        s.method();// it will give u the error as local variables should be initialized.
    }
}

 The default value is applicable for data memebers only.

Memeory allocation for refernence data type is done during runtime using new operator.
