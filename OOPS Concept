Inheritance
-----------

The process of creating a new class from an existing class is called inheritance.

Extend keyword is used to create a new class from an existing class.

Syntax:


class  vechile{

}

class car extends vechile{

}

Through inheritance we can achieve reusability of code.


Java does not support multiple inheritance due to ambiguity means in java a class an extend only for one class.
