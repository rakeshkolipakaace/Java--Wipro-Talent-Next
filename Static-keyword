Static keyword
--------------

static keyword can be used for data memebers and methods and inner classes.

static keyword cannot be used for top level classes (outer classes).

Example:

static class sample{}//error

static keyword can be used for local variables (declared within a method).

Example:

class sample{
    void method(){
        static int n;//error-local variables cannot be static
    }
}


static memebers are accessible directly with the class without creating objects.

object can also access static memebers.

A static method can access only other static memebrs directly.

A static variable acts as a global variable within class means all objects of the class can access static variables Memeory.




Packages:
---------

Packages is a collection of relatec classes (.class files)

package keyword is used to create a package.

In a source code file we can have only one package statememts with multiple imports and class declarations.

The classes under the package are stored in a folder whose name is same as the package name.

Only public classes are accessbile outside the package.


To use classes of one package into another we need to import the package.

Example : import mypackage.A; (package with class name)
           
                              or 

         import mypackage.*; (package with all classes)
