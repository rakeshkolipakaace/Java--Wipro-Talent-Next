OOPS stands for Object Oriented Programming System.

OOPS is a programming paradigm that uses objects to represent real-world entities.


Object Oriented Concepts/features
-----------------------------------
1.Object
2.Classes
3.Abstraction
4.Inheritance
5.Encapsulation
6.Polymorphism


this keyword
------------
this keyword is used to refer to the current object.

this is generally used to differentiate data memebers of a class and arguments of a method when the names are same.


Constructors
------------
A constructor is a special method whose name is same as the classname used to initialize the object and does not return 

anything not even void..

Syntax:

class sample{
    int m;
    void sample(int n)// an ordinary method 
    {
        m = n;
    }
    sample(int n)// constructor name same as classname
    {
        m = n;
    }

}


points on constructors
-----------------------


1. Constructors are called when an object is created.

2.If a class does not have a constructor, then the compiler automatically creates a default constructor for that class.

3.The default constructor is called implicitly when an object is created.


If  a class contians parameterized constructor then it is the responsiblity of the programmer to create default constructor in the class.


Example:

cclass Item {
    int m;

    Item(int n)// parameterized constructor
     {
        m = n;
    }

    Item() {}//default constructor

    void display() {
        System.out.println(m);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Item i = new Item(10);
        i.display();
        Item j = new Item();
        j.display();
    }
}
